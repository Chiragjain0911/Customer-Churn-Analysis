# Customer-Churn-Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of customer churn patterns in the telecom industry, identifying key attrition drivers and recommending retention strategies.

## Key Insights
- **Top 3 Churn Drivers:** 
  1. Fiber optic internet users (43% churn rate)
  2. Customers without tech support (47% churn)
  3. Month-to-month contracts (3x higher churn than annual)
- **Most Loyal Customers:** Those with long-term contracts and add-on services
- **Actionable Recommendation:** Target high-risk groups with personalized incentives

## ðŸ› Technologies Used
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Google Colab
This project analyzes why customers leave their telecom provider (called "churn"). It looks at customer data to find patterns that help predict who might cancel their service.

Key Things We Learned
Internet service matters: People with fiber internet leave most often (43% leave)

Support is key: Customers without tech support leave 47% of the time

Contracts help: People on monthly plans leave 3x more than those with yearly contracts

Price sensitivity: Customers paying over $70/month are twice as likely to leave

How We Did It
Cleaned the data: Fixed missing info and organized 7,000+ customer records

Looked for patterns: Compared different groups of customers

Built prediction models: Created tools that can guess with 82% accuracy who might leave

What Companies Should Do
Help fiber internet users: Maybe improve service or offer discounts

Include tech support: Bundle it for free with other services

Encourage yearly contracts: Offer deals for customers who sign longer contracts
